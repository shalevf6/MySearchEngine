# My Search Engine - A Search Engine Project
This is the first part of the Search Engine Project which is part of the Information Retrieval Course.
Through this application, you can index and create a posting lists file and dictionaries for a given corpus
that answers the rules given by the course's stuff.

## Setup
The application was written in Java, so see that Java is installed on your computer.

In order to run the application, simply download the file "MySearchEngine.jar" and double click it.

## List of the buttons and other elements in the main window and their respective functionalities:
### There are 2 "Browse" buttons that open up a File Chooser window:
1. The upper "Browse" button is for getting the path of the folder of the corpus(the
   data set) and within it the stop words file. It's important that the corpuse's
   folder will be named "corpus" (without the apostrophes), and that the stop words
   file will be named: "stop_words.text", or the application will not run.
2. The lower "Browse" button is for getting the folder in which all the data files,
   meaning all the posting files and dictionaries, will be saved in.
You can write the path of the files in the text box next to each "Browse" button as well.
### The "Stemming" check box:
While checked, it will do one of 2 things:
1. If the "Activate" button will be pressed, it will alert the system the the indexing
   process will not be using stemming.
2. If the "Load Dictionary" button will be pressed, it will alert the system that the
   posting files and dictionaries that are loaded didn't went through stemming (and save
   them accordingly).
   
While unchecked, it will do one of 2 things:
1. If the "Activate" button will be pressed, it will alert the system the the indexing
   process will be using stemming.
2. If the "Load Dictionary" button will be pressed, it will alert the system that the
   posting files and dictionaries that are loaded gone through stemming.
### The "Activate" button:
The "Activate" button starts the indexing process, with / without stemming (depends if
the "Stemming" checkbox is checked / unchecked), using the corpus given as input, and
writes the posting files and dictionaries to the posting path given as input.
Without using the 2 "Browse" buttons (or text boxes) to choose the necessary paths, the
"Activate" button will not work.
This process will usually take 10 to 15 minutes for a corpus with about half a million
documents, depends on whether you check "Stemming" or not. It will pop up an alert when
it's done with the time the index process took, the number of documents that were indexed,
and the amount of unique terms that were indexed.
If one of the paths doesn't exist, or the path for the corpus doesn't include the corpus
directory or the stop words file inside it, an appropriate error alert will be shown.
### The "Load Dictionary" button:
The "Load Dictionary" button opens up a file chooser window. You should choose the parent
directory of the directory which all the posting and dictionary files are saved in. After 
selecting a right directory, it starts the loading process, with / without stemming (depends
if the "Stemming" checkbox was checked / unchecked).
This process will take less than 10 to 40 seconds for a corpus with about half a million
documents, depends on whether you checked "Stemming" or not. It will pop up an alert when
it's done.
If the path doesn't exist, or the directory in the path doesn't include all the necessary
files, an appropriate error alert will be shown.
### The "Reset" button:
The "Reset" button will erase all of the data saved (if any) in the disk under the posting
path, and all of the data saved in the main memory as well (all the dictionaries).
### The "Show Dictionary" button:
The "Show Dictionary" button will open a new window with all of the unique terms in the
current dictionary (after indexing or loading), sorted by lexicographic order, with the
amount of times each of the terms were found in total in the data set.
Keep in mind, the "Show dictionary" button will work only after loading / indexing a
dataset beforehand. Pressing the "Reset" button will of course mean that only after 
another loading / indexing, the "Show Dictionary" button will work again.
### The "Language Chooser" button:
The "Language Chooser" button will open a small window with a choice box full of all the
languages found in the data set.
Keep in mind, the "Show dictionary" button will work only after loading / indexing a
dataset beforehand. Pressing the "Reset" button will of course mean that only after 
another loading / indexing, the "Show Dictionary" button will work again.
### Addidtional data about the synchornization between "Activate" and "Load Dictionaries":
The application is able to handle any combinition of order between "Activate" and "Load
Dictionary" with or without stemming, given that all of that is done on the same corpus.
For example, you can load all the stemmed posting files of the corpus and after it press
"Activate" for the non-stemming option.
Keep in notice, that after Indexing / Loading in both options (Stemming / Not Stemming),
the application will not allow another Loading / Indexing.

## Files and directories structure:
After running the application, there will be some files and directories created on your
computer, under the path that was given as input in the lower "Browse" button or the
"Load Dictionary" button. I will now explain the structure of those files.

If you were loading / indexing a corpus with stemming, a directory named "postingFilesWithStemming"
will be created, and under it 4 files:
1. mainPosting - which is the posting file for all the terms in the dictionary (stemmed). can also be
				 viewed as text.
2. termDictionary - which is a hashMap of all the terms as keys that is saved as an object.
3. documentDictionary - which is a hashMap of all the documents as keys that is saved as an object.
4. dictionaryForShow - that is a LinkedList<String> of all the terms in the dictionary, that is saved
					   as an object, for when you click the "Show Dictionary" button.

If you were loading / indexing a corpus without stemming, a directory named "postingFilesWithoutStemming"
will be created, and under it 4 files:
1. mainPosting - which is the posting file for all the terms in the dictionary (not stemmed). can also
be viewed as text.
2. termDictionary - which is a hashMap of all the terms as keys that is saved as an object.
3. documentDictionary - which is a hashMap of all the documents as keys that is saved as an object.
4. dictionaryForShow - that is a LinkedList<String> of all the terms in the dictionary, that is saved
					   as an object, for when you click the "Show Dictionary" button.
					   
Additionaly, there will be another directory named "postingForCities" that will be created once after
the first Indexing / Loading, with the 2 following files inside it:
1. mainCityPosting - which is the posting file for all the cities in the dictionary. can also be
					 viewed as text.
2. cityDictionary - which is a hashMap of all the cities as keys that is saved as an object.

Furthermore, one file (not a directory) named "languages" will be created after one Loading / Indexing,
which is a List<String> of all the languages in the data set.
